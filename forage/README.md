# JPMorgan Forage Program: Quantitative Research Task Instructions

## Overview of JPMorgan Forage

JPMorgan Forage is a virtual program designed to provide participants with a hands-on experience of the tasks and responsibilities that a quantitative researcher may encounter in their career journey. Through a series of tasks, participants gain insights into real-world applications of quantitative analysis, data modeling, and forecasting techniques.

## Task Instructions

In this task, you will focus on analyzing historical natural gas price data and extrapolating future prices. The goal is to enable trading of natural gas storage contracts by providing accurate pricing information based on past trends and seasonal variations.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Obtain the monthly natural gas price data, which includes market prices recorded at the end of each month. The data spans from **October 31, 2020, to September 30, 2024**.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Utilize the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model to analyze the historical price data. This model helps identify trends and seasonal patterns that are critical for accurate forecasting.

3. **Forecasting**:
   - Implement the SARIMA model to estimate the price of natural gas for any given date in the past and to extrapolate prices for an additional year into the future.
   - Develop a function that takes a specific date as input and returns the estimated natural gas price.

4. **Considerations for Accuracy**:
   - Be aware that the accuracy of the forecasts is dependent on the model parameters and the characteristics of the data. Regular reassessments are necessary as new data becomes available.
   - Consider the external factors influencing natural gas prices, such as geopolitical events and regulatory changes, which may not be captured in the historical data.

5. **Evaluation of Results**:
   - Analyze the results of the SARIMA model and assess its performance against historical data trends. Consider the limitations of relying solely on historical price data for forecasting.

## Conclusion

The successful completion of this task will demonstrate your ability to apply quantitative research techniques to real-world problems in the commodity trading space. By using the SARIMA model, you will provide valuable insights into the pricing of natural gas storage contracts and help inform trading strategies.
